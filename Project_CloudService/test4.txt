HE was the second son of the Duke de Bouillon, by Elizabeth of Nassau,
daughter of William the Silent and Charlotte de Montpensier. De Bouillon
was attached in early life to Henry the Fourth, King of France and
Navarre, who spoke of him as ‘my lieutenant, my friend, and comrade.’
The Duke was a soldier, diplomat, politician, and man of letters; and,
moreover, founder of the Academy at Sedan, which became the resort of
all the youthful nobility and chivalry of Europe.
